Thank you very much for taking the time to attend an interview for the Internship position and my apologies for the delayed confirmation of the outcome as I know you were expecting to hear from us last week. 
 
The standard of interviews was extremely high and unfortunately, your application was unsuccessful. Initially, also we had a high number of applications and the process was competitive, so you did extremely well to get through to the interview stage. 
 
I wish you all the best with your future endeavors.
