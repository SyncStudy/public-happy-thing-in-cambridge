 
As we noted earlier, the decision on your application mainly reflect the fact that we were unable to accommodate all applications to the consortium this year.  The available slots are allocated based on the pool of applicants, the stage of development of their dissertation proposal, how well their research fit the intended scope of the consortium as well with the expertise of this year’s faculty panelists.  I hope this helps.  Best,



 
正如我们之前所指出的，对你的申请做出决定主要是反映了一个事实，即我们今年无法满足所有的联合体申请。 可用的名额是根据申请人的数量、他们的论文提案的发展阶段、他们的研究是否符合联合体的预期范围以及今年的教师小组成员的专业知识来分配的。 我希望这对您有所帮助。 最好。
