Dear registrant,
 
We missed you at our webinar last Thursday, and we thought you might be interested in watching it when you have some spare time.
 
We’ve curated the video so that you can easily navigate the different parts of the session:
00:00 Why a Fellowship with Xenia Perez Sitja
09:30 The activities and how to apply with Robert Andrews
26:11 Experiences from Fellows: Emma Karoune, Korneel Hens, Andrew Mason
33:40 Q: How much support did you need from your organisation?
34:40 Q: Did your manager think your participation would have a negative impact?
38:58 Q: Why are the videos the Fellows produce so short?
39:59 Q: How much do you need to travel?
40:39 Q: Do you need to be in the UK to apply?
